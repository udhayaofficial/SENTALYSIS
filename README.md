# SENTALYSIS
Sentiment analysis of Resume/CV which is used to classify whether the resume is strong or weak based on the keywords or a specialization given by the candidate.
Sentimental analysis (SA) forms part of opinion mining where consumers are
identified to give the attitudes, emotions, and opinions towards a firm’s brand,
product, and service offered. Opinion mining (OM) and sentimental analysis (SA)
are used interchangeably since they define a mutual meaning. OM and SA are
different as OM can extract and analyze opinions people make on an entity while
SA makes sentimental identification in a text and finally examines it. SA, therefore,
targets to get opinions, identify expressed sentiments and then classify them by their
polarity.
Sentimental Analysis is, therefore, a process of classification. It is divided into three primary
levels: the document, sentence, and aspect levels. Sentimental Analysis (document level)
module analyzes a text piece and determines whether it has a positive or negative sentiment.
The document-level sentimental analysis supports the following languages: the UK and US
English, German, Spanish, French and Italian. The module is configured in such a way that it
never runs automatically during the workflow of data processing.
The sentimental analysis uses a single text default output with one of the following values:
POSITIVE, NEGATIVE. An empty or null input returns a NULL. Sentence-level SA
classifies the sentiment expressed in each of the sentences. It establishes whether the judgment
is objective or subjective in nature. Sentence level SA applies a determination of whether a
sentence is positive, negative or neutral when analyzing a subjective statement. 


Sentimental analysis is applied to reviews of consumer insights. Marketing teams and
customer service targets the feelings and opinions of their product’s consumers. In product
reviews satisfaction or dissatisfaction of a consumer can be expressed through sentimental
analysis. Analysis of the impact of a new product, a campaign ad in the market can also be


implemented through sentimental analysis (Pozzi, Fersini, Messina, 58). Sentimental analysis
allows customer service agent to categorize their emails depending on the urgency purely
based on the email’s sentiment so as to identify frustrated consumers. The system is also
applied in business intelligence to establish the reasons (subjective) why clients are responding
or not responding to a product.
